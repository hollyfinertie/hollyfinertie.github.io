Hello! 

My name is Holly. I'm currently living in NYC and attending Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, I received a BA in Economics from UCLA in 2014 and worked in consulting for several years prior to pursuing my masters. I love beer, daschunds, and biostatistics (in that order). 


This is me:
