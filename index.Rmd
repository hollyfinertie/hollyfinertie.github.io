Hello!

My name is Holly. I'm currently living in NYC and attending Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, I received a BA in Economics from UCLA in 2014 and worked in hospital reimbursement consulting prior to pursuing my Master's. 

Upon receiving my MPH, I hope to move back to the Bay and work in health technology. I believe that some of the most innovative and successful strategies to combat health inequity are in health tech. Also, I love big data and data science. In the last five years, I have learned how to manipulate data through multiple lenses - as a consultant and as a public health expert. Both lenses have taught me valuable lessons in how to display data and find efficient solutions.
